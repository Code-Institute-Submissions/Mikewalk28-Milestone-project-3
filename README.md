# Overhead Manager

Overhead Manager is a simple to use timesheet platform where you can post your work hours based upon your work sector. The example used is based on some previous real life work undertaken in an architects firm. The data used, uses actual overhead costing but the names and values have all changed due to confidentiality. The idea originally arose from a period of work experience undertaken where I worked out the cost analysis and management reports for the company to help them work out their profitability ratios per sector.

### As a user I want to:

* I want to be able to discuss the website with other potential users.

# Design

## Imagery and colour scheme

* The colour scheme of the site was given careful consideration. The colours used in the website is important to the overall experience of the user.
* The colour scheme was chosen based on what colours are easy on the eye and also bearing in the mind the colour scheme of accounting software.
* Once the colours were chosen, it was a test to see if they blended together, the gentle red is easy on the eye and the green is just enough to capture the attention of where the user needs to go.
  
## Layout

The website is split into 3 sections:

* Home
* Timesheets
* Reports

## Timesheets and reports features

### Timesheet Page
![Timesheet Page](images/timesheet.png)
* When the user clicks the timesheet page, this is what they are greeted with.
    * They then choose the sector they wish to post into,
    * Their name,
    * How many hours they worked
*  After this they are then greeted with a view of the current state of hours worked in the month

* After this, the use can choose to input another timesheet where they will be redirected back to the front page to be able to post another timesheet.

### Reports Section
![Reports Page](images/reports_page.png)
* This is the section where the user can view data from previous financial years to compare how long they spent working on projects in other sectors.
* This is for the management to look at as the data in here would grasp on teh financials and show you in a clear concise way where time is being spent as well as where the money is being earned.

### Layout change

* The layout of the website changed mostly due to the idea being changed. Originally this was going to be a cost managment system for manufacturing products, however, this idea would have been over time consuming and impractical. The idea became to just focus on the analytical areas on the information I already had stored from my time working in the company.
* The idea still pulls through from the google sheet, using two different ones for the different sections. Timesheets uses the current month sheet, where reports uses the old financial year sheet.
